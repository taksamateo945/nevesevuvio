Whatever business she does to make a living is in the internet space. As mentioned, the star is famous for the lip-syncs, dances, and comedy-related clips she posts on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>TikTok</a>.</p><p>This transformed her from a nobody to the celebrity status she can boast of today.

Beauty and Soft have been spotted several times in TikTok videos together. Because of this, fans have concluded that the duo is in a romantic relationship with each other.</p><p>Also, Softmadeit used to feature different girls in his videos. This made his fans see him as promiscuous. In a bid to change how his fans see him, Soft decided to stick to one woman, Beauty Goddess. This, again, has sparked rumors that they are in a relationship.</p><p>However, Beauty Goddess and Softmadeit have debunked the rumors in TikTok and YouTube videos. They maintain that they are not dating and that they only appear in videos and song promos together because their fans, as well as the musicians they promote their songs, yearn for such.</p><h2><strong>What Happened Between Softmadeit and Beauty Goddess?</strong></h2><p>Beauty has <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>denied</a> being in a relationship with Softmadeit several times. She has maintained that nothing happened between them. According to her, they are really close but were never dating. As such, they did not break up because they were never in a relationship at first.</p><p>Soft has also denied ever dating Softmadeit. In fact, Beauty is not interested in a love relationship at the moment; but agrees that she is going to get married when the time is right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571qGmZqGjYq%2BmrdStsGafn5mxpr%2FSZquhnV2jtqix0aKYp2Wknri1u8pmqq2ZomQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-beauty-goddess-the-nigerian-tiktok-star.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-beauty-goddess-the-nigerian-tiktok-star.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-beauty-goddess-the-nigerian-tiktok-star.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-beauty-goddess-the-nigerian-tiktok-star.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-beauty-goddess-the-nigerian-tiktok-star.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-beauty-goddess-the-nigerian-tiktok-star.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./10118997-bills-josh-allen-texted-keon-coleman-youre-the-guy-i-want-during-2024-nfl-draft.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./10118997-bills-josh-allen-texted-keon-coleman-youre-the-guy-i-want-during-2024-nfl-draft.html>Bills' Josh Allen Texted Keon Coleman 'You're the Guy I Want' During 2024 NFL Draft | News, Scores,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bart-simpson-will-die-on-the-simpsons-halloween-episode-201586.html>Bart Simpson Will Die on The Simpsons' Halloween Episode</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bart-simpson-will-die-on-the-simpsons-halloween-episode-201586.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
