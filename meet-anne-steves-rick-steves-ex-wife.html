<time>15 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Anne Steves is the ex-wife of Rick Steves, who came to the limelight due to her over two decades-long marriage to Rick, the media personality and published author.</strong></p><p>Anne Steves and Rick Steves met and fell in love in 1982 and decided to cement their relationship after two years of dating. Their union produced two children but hit the rocks sometime in 2009, and they finalized their divorce in 2010.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Anne Steves’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Anne Steves</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> White</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Divorced</li><li><strong>Anne Steves’s Ex-Husband:</strong> Rick Steves</li><li><strong>Anne Steves’s Children:</strong> Andy and Jackie Steves</li><li><strong>Anne Steves’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 8 inches</li><li><strong>Anne Steves’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 172 cm</li><li><strong>Anne Steves’s Weight:</strong> 58 kg</li><li><strong>Famous For:</strong> Being the ex-wife of Rick Steves</li></ul><h2><strong>Where Was Anne Steves Born?</strong></h2><p>The record’s captured Anne Steves’s place of birth as the Washington State in the US; her hometown is Snohomish, to be precise. Though her exact birthdate is unknown, searches revealed that the ex-wife of Rick Steves was born within the late 50s.</p><p>Being born in the United States makes her an American by nationality, but her ethnic background is listed as White. Despite being the wife of a TV personality of Rick’s caliber for several years, Anne still managed to keep details about her early life and family background away from the prying eyes of the media and the general public.</p><p>Thus, there is nothing to go by about her parents and siblings. However, it has been established that she comes from a Christian home.&nbsp;In the same ways as her family background, Anne’s academic history is equally under the shade.</p><h3><strong>She is Said To Be A Qualified Nurse</strong></h3><p>What Anne Steves did for a living eluded the media for several years as she seemed to be a stay-at-home mum all through her marriage with the celebrated American TV personality and travel writer. However, it recently came to the fore that Anne was once engaged in the health sector as a nurse, and needless to say, this must have happened before she hooked up with Rick. The mother of two is also listed as a social activist.</p><h2><strong>Anne Steves Met Rick Steves In 1982</strong></h2><p>Anne Steves first crossed paths with Rick Steves (the man who would become her husband) as far back as 1982. Rick works as a media personality and a publishing author. The duo happened to be in a Barstow, Californian-based restaurant at the same time when they met. That particular meeting ushered in a long relationship that lasted for over a couple of years before they decided to seal their love through a nuptial bond.</p><h3><strong>She Became Rick Steves’ Wife In 1984</strong></h3><p>Though the exact date of their wedding is not known, Anne and Rick exchanged wedding vows in 1984 in what was described as an intimate ceremony. After they were joined together at St. Thomas of Villanova, the couple and their guests moved to Saint David Gold Club for the after-party.&nbsp;Married life was quite cozy for the duo as they toured around Europe for both work and pleasure.</p><h3><strong>Anne and Rick Steves Share Two Children</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/Anne-Steves-e1661332668165.png><p>Love blossomed for over two decades between the couple, producing two children – a son named Andy Steves and a daughter named Jackie Steves. Though their birth details have never surfaced anywhere on the internet space, the Steves children are all grownups and are following the same career path as Rick.</p><p>Andy is already an author with one travel guide, Andy Steves’ Europe: City-Hopping on a Budget, under his belt. The youngster has also launched his own travel company, Weekend Student Adventures Europe.</p><p>Andy and Jackie work with Rick; the trio is often seen traveling around Europe, filming TV shows, and researching guidebooks. In fact, traveling has become a family business for the Steves family, and they have even launched a travel blog for the convenience of travelers who wish to search for relevant information.</p><h2><strong>Are Rick and Anne Steves Still Married?</strong></h2><p>As the years rolled by, fans began to see Rick and Anne Steves’ marriage as the “happily ever after” type, and they were shocked when things began to go sour for the couple around 2009. Whatever the issue was, it lingered for so long that the duo had to consider the option of divorce.</p><p>Reports did not say who made the first move, but the couple’s divorce request was filed in Anne’s hometown, precisely at the Snohomish Superior Court in 2009. This set the divorce proceeding into motion, and within barely a year, their divorce was finalized on the 5th of March 2010. The custody of their son and daughter was shared equally between the couple.</p><h3><strong>What Led to Rick and Anne’s Divorce?</strong></h3><p>To date, neither Rick nor Anne Steves deemed it necessary to come open with the circumstances that led to their divorce, and needless to say, this birthed a lot of speculations from fans.</p><p>One version of the ensuing speculations said it was Rick who made the first move to divorce Anne as the father of two had already found a new love interest. The rumors identified Rick’s new love as Trish Feaster, his travel partner. Besides, Rick seemed to lend credence to the speculations when in 2012, he took to his blog to name Trish his new girlfriend.</p><p>Even with Rick’s revelations in 2012, the rumors that rent the air about him and Trish in 2009 could not be substantiated as the duo never clarified when they started dating. Thus, there is no way to know whether Rick was cheating on Anne with Trish.</p><p>Another version of Rick and Anne Steves’ reasons for divorce said one of them might be gay. However, the speculators couldn’t lay their hands on any prominent evidence to substantiate that.</p><h2><strong>Where is Anne Steves Now?</strong></h2><p>The whereabouts of Anne Steves after her divorce from Rick Steves is unknown. The mother of two wasted no time returning to her private life, making it impossible for anybody to keep tabs on her activities and whereabouts. It is unknown whether she has been in any other relationship, though she still resides in the US.</p><p>The story is, however, different for her ex-husband Rick who has dated at least two women after their divorce. Still a resident of Edmond, Washington, Rick is very much active in his television shows and travel business.</p><h2><strong>Quick Facts About Anne Steves, Rick Steves’ Ex-wife</strong></h2><p><strong>Who is Anne Steves?</strong> Anne Steves is an American nurse, social activist, and the ex-wife of Rick Steves, a renowned novelist and travel writer.</p><p><strong>What is known about Anne Steves’ personal life?</strong> Much of Anne’s life remains private.
