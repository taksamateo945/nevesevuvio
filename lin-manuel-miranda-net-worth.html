He was born on January 16, 1980 in New York City. He grew up in Inwood and spent one month of every summer at his grandparent’s home in Puerto Rico, where his family always considered home. His father was a political advisor who worked with Ed Koch, and even Lin-Manuel Miranda worked a bit in politics growing up. He spent a great deal of his time working on jingles for political campaigns such as Eliot Spitzer’s back in the 2006 election. When it was time for him to attend college, he decided that Wesleyan University would be a wonderful location for his career. He went there and graduated in 2002.</p><p>While in college, he was the cofounder of a comedy group called Freestyle Love Supreme, and he also worked in music while he was in college. It was in 1999 that he began writing In the Heights. It took him three years and five drafts to really make it what he wanted, and that’s when Lin-Manuel Miranda’s life began to change. He began working with Thomas Kail, a director, and the musical was an off-Broadway success in New York City. As the popularity of the show began to grow out of control, it became clear that this was going to become a Broadway musical. By 2008, it was a Broadway musical.</p><p>He is a man who knew what he wanted to do with his life long before he actually did it. He knew he wanted to do something that involved creating an amazing work, and that he would work the music for it. He has had a wonderful talent for creating and writing music and then composing it since he was only a child, and it is a skill that has worked well for him his entire life. He has a lot of talent doing what he does, and it has paid off for him in a major way. What started out as a hobby, something he enjoyed to do with his free time, began turning into a real career. That was in 2008. By the time 2009 rolled around, the musical was one so good that it won several prestigious awards.</p><p>Miranda took hom a Tony Award for the Best Musical and one for the Best Original Score, and even he was nominated as the best actor in a musical, though he did not win that award. In 2009, the same year the play took home so many Tony’s, it also won the Grammy for the Best Musical Theater Album. The little play that could turned into something that did. From that point on, Lin-Manuel Miranda began working on other ventures, including a few films, more musicals and more music. He is one of the most famous playwrights and composers of this generation, and people know him for his amazing talent creating music that can make you feel something that few other sounds can make you feel.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGijoqZdoq6vwcSlZKahopa7pa2Mp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flin-manuel-miranda-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flin-manuel-miranda-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flin-manuel-miranda-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flin-manuel-miranda-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flin-manuel-miranda-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flin-manuel-miranda-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./104641-dollface-cast-crew-who-actors-hulus-comedy-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./104641-dollface-cast-crew-who-actors-hulus-comedy-html.html>Dollface cast and crew: Who are the actors in Hulu's comedy?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kristi-lee.html>Kristi Lee Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kristi-lee.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
